# Problem 1

---------------------------------------------------
Parameter                                Constraint
------------------------------------ --------------
$\Pr$(Disease = true)                $\ge 0.008942$

$\Pr$(Test = true | Disease = false) $\le 0.002219$

$\Pr$(Test = false | Disease = true) N/A
---------------------------------------------------

Setting $\Pr$(Test = false | Disease = true) doesn't seem to have an effect
significant enough to satisfy $\Pr$(Disease = true | Test = true) $\ge 0.3$ on
its own.

# Problem 2

A) The answer can be found by selecting the value of "On" for the Light Sensor
   variable, and the value of "Off" for the Sound Sensor variable, then using
   SamIam's MPE function. Alternatively, one can select the value for each
   remaining variable with the highest calculated probability given the values for
   Light Sensor and Sound Sensor.

   ----------------------------
   Variable              Value
   -------------------- -------
   Battery                OK
   
   Dog Barking?           No
   
   Dog Bowel Trouble      Yes
   
   Dog Outside            Yes
   
   Expecting Guests       No
   
   Family Home            No
   
   Hearable Barking?      No
   
   Light Sensor Health    OK
   
   Outdoor Light          On
   
   Sound Sensor Health    OK
   ----------------------------

B) The answer can be found by selecting the value of "Yes" for the Family Home
   variable, and the value of "No" for the Expecting Guests variable, then using
   SamIam's MAP function to find the most probable values of Light Sensor and
   Sound Sensor. Alternatively, these can be found using SamIam's MPE function,
   or by calculating the probabilities of each node with the given variables set
   and choosing the most probable setting of Light Sensor and Sound Sensor.

   ----------------------------
   Variable              Value
   -------------------- -------
   Light Sensor           Off
   
   Sound Sensor           Off
   ----------------------------

C) $\mathbb{Z} = \{ \text{Battery, Family Home} \}$

   Choosing the variable Battery blocks the path through it between the sensors;
   there is no other way to block this path other than including this variable in
   $\mathbb{Z}$.
   
   Choosing the variable Family Home blocks the alternative path between the two
   sensors, although there are several other variable choices that accomplish
   the d-separation of the two sensors.

D) This is a multiply-connected network as the variables
     $$\{ \text{Family Home, Expecting Guests, Outdoor Light} \}$$
   form a loop.
